                You may use the services provided by FamilyRoomRentals only if you agree to the Terms of Use ("Terms") and 
                are not a person that has been prohibed to receive such services. There are two ways to use FamilyRoomRentals,
                a person looking to rent a property, and a person looking to adquire a property. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The person looking to rent a property will need a FamilyRoomRentals account, for which will have to agree to 
                the Terms of Use ("Terms") and have a clear legal status. Such person can post and share content with others. 
                After posting the property, this person will receive notifications / offers regarding to such posting. These notifications / offers can
                be accepted or rejected. If the offer is accepted, this person will meet with the offer's holder and if an 
                agreement is made to actually move in to the property, then FamilyRoomRentals will compensate the person renting
                the property with $10. This will happen everytime an agreement is made. If the offer is rejected, then there will be
                no compensation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The person looking to adquire and actually move into a property, will need to send offers for which will have to agree
                to the Terms of Use ("Terms") of FamilyRoomRentals. In this case, to submit an offer, a FamilyRoomRentals's account is
                optional. After an offer is submitted, this person will be notified on whether such offer was accepted or rejected. If
                the offer was accepted, then this person will need to meet with the person renting the property, take a look at the property,
                and then determine if the property is convenient or not. To make such meeting possible and move forward in the proccess, 
                FamilyRoomRentals charges a $20 fee. If the for which if paid, you authorize us to charge the provided payment method. 
                Any tax is additional. If the result of the offer is to move into the property, such fee in non-refundable. 
                However, if after paying the $20 and meeting with the person renting the property, as a result, no agreement 
                was made, then FamilyRoomRentals guarantee a $10 refund, if requested. Such request must be made at 30 days 
                after the meeting. After 30 days, such request will be denied.
